            <h2>The Ripple Effect of Your Actions</h2>
            <p>Segregating your waste seems like a small act, but it triggers a massive chain reaction that benefits everyone. This goes far beyond just "helping the environment."</p>
            
            <div class="ripple-content">
                <div class="ripple-point">
                    <h4>Economic Boost</h4>
                    <p>When you segregate, you create clean streams of recyclable materials (paper, plastic, metal). This reduces the cost for industries to buy new raw materials and creates thousands of jobs in the recycling and waste management sectors.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ripple-point">
                    <h4>Public Health Improvement</h4>
                    <p>Unsegregated waste, especially mixed with food scraps, rots in landfills, attracting pests and creating diseases. By separating wet waste, you dramatically reduce landfill smell, contamination of groundwater, and the spread of illness.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ripple-point">
                    <h4>Resource Conservation</h4>
                    <p>Every item you recycle is one less item that needs to be created from scratch. Recycling paper saves trees, recycling plastic saves oil, and recycling metal saves finite ores. It's a direct way to conserve Earth's natural resources.</p>
